A prolific composer, pianist, and Brazil's first female conductor, Chiquinha Gonzaga (1847-1945) composed an expansive selection of piano miniatures and incidental music for theatre. Her early Romantic style and penchant for elegant melodies combined with her willingness to embrace the popular musical styles of Brazil, even in aristocratic environments, led her to lifelong success as a composer.

Liberian-Norwegian pianist Kamilla Arku gave her London debut at the renowned 'Pianists of the World' series at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields in 2013, and has since performed as a soloist and chamber musician at festivals and recitals in the UK and abroad. Recent highlights include recitals in London, Munich and Paris; performances on BBC Radio 3's 'In Tune' and on BBC Radio London; chamber music performances with Stephen Kovacevich, Alice Zawadzki and Leon Bosch; and world and European premieres of works by Lainie Fefferman, Tara Creme and Virginia Seay. She has also creatively collaborated with visual artists Jordan SÃ¶derberg Mills and Amale Freiha Khlat as well as with filmmaker Patrick Hamm.

She is committed to volunteer efforts, and since 2008 has organised concerts and events in aid of Liberian children with her charity, Music for Liberia. Kamilla is a graduate of Yale University and the Royal Northern College of Music, and is currently based between London and Berlin.
